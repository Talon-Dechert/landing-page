# landing-page
First Odin Project based on the html-css foundations

I will attempt to recreate a static, single-page website with only HTML
and CSS.

Some notes after completing this exercise:
- Divvying up the divs can be better done through regularly practiced layout styles

- Semantic HTML should be included from the start

- Header divs likely won't align very well when kept entirely separate as they are here
